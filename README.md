  ðŸ’« Graph-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics data
</b></i></p>

Novae is a deep learning model for spatial domain assignments of spatial transcriptomics data (at both single-cell or spot resolution). It works across multiple gene panels, tissues, and technologies. Novae offers several additional features, including: (i) native batch-effect correction, (ii) analysis of spatially variable genes and pathways, and (iii) architecture analysis of tissue slides.

> [!NOTE]
> Novae was developed by the authors of [`sopa`](https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa) and is part of the [`scverse`](https://scverse.org/) ecosystem.

## Documentation

Check [Novae's documentation](https://mics-lab.github.io/novae/) to get started. It contains installation explanations, API details, and tutorials.

</p>

> **(a)** Novae was trained on a large dataset, and is shared on [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/MICS-Lab/novae-669cdf1754729d168a69f6bd). **(b)** Illustration of the main tasks and properties of Novae. **(c)** Illustration of the method behind Novae (self-supervision on graphs, adapted from [SwAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882)).

## Installation

`novae` can be installed via `PyPI` on all OS, for any Python version from `3.10` to `3.12` (included).

```
pip install novae
```

> [!NOTE]
> See this [installation section](https://mics-lab.github.io/novae/getting_started/) for more details about extras and other installations modes.

## Usage

Here is a minimal usage example. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://mics-lab.github.io/novae/).

```python
import novae

model = novae.Novae.from_pretrained("MICS-Lab/novae-human-0")

model.compute_representations(adata, zero_shot=True)
model.assign_domains(adata)
```
