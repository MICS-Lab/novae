Therefore, you can compute spatial domains in a zero-shot manner or quickly fine-tune the model.</li> <li>It has been developed to find consistent domains across many slides. This also works if you have different technologies (e.g., MERSCOPE/Xenium) and multiple gene panels.</li> <li>You can natively correct the spatial-domains batch-effect, without using external tools.</li> <li>After inference, the spatial domain assignment is super fast, allowing you to try multiple resolutions easily.</li> <li>It supports many downstream tasks, all included inside one framework.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"advice/","title":"Usage advice","text":"<p>Here, we list some advice to help you get the best out of Novae.</p>"},{"location":"advice/#high-quality-training-subset","title":"High-quality training subset","text":"<p>When you have many slides, it's recommended to train or fine-tune Novae only on the good quality slides and run inference (i.e., spatial domain assignment) on all slides.

This allows to recompute the model prototypes (i.e., the centroids of the spatial domains) based on the chosen slides.</p> <ul> <li>For zero-shot, we use <code>reference=\"all\"</code> by default, meaning we use all slides to recompute the prototypes. Depending on your use case, you may consider specifying one or multiple representative slides.</li> <li>For fine-tuning, we use <code>reference=None</code> by default, meaning we will initialize the prototypes randomly, and re-train them.
